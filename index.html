        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>Currently, I work as a part-time freelance designer and a junior
            researcher at Belarus National Academy of Sciences. Coding has long
            been a hobby of mine, and I began learning many programming
            languages but never settled on one due to a lack of a defined
            direction. Being a quick learner I am adept at acquiring new
            techniques and gaining new skills. In addition to having good
            interpersonal skills and being an outgoing person, I am an effective
            team player. I am a very determined person, therefore whenever I
            start a project, I make every effort to complete it as quickly as
            possible.</p>
        <p> I believe that once I gain the right education and experience I
            would become a professional developer and have move ways to expand
            my knowledge.</p>
