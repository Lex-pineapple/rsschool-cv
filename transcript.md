Hi! My name is Sasha, I'm 24 and I am a Junior Researcher at the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. I received my formal education at Belarusian State University, where I majored in Biochemistry, followed by a master's degree in biology, and right now I'm studying to become a Frontend Developer at Rolling Scopes School.

To begin, I'd like to state that I really enjoy studying and learning new things, so applying to this course seemed like a solid idea: it would give me a purpose, as well as the ability to further integrate with the IT community, to get some good and structured study program, and it would set a strict schedule that I would want to adhere to in order to achieve my goal.

Prior to applying for this course, I dabbled in writing small programs in Java and C languages while also trying to learn the programming language in question, but I never had any clear sense of direction in which I wished to develop myself or any explicit purpose that I wanted to reach.

After learning the fundamentals of development and completing a couple of individual projects, I just fell in love with this line of work. Just being able to see something you coded working and it actually being useful is amazing!

So, once I had a good enough understanding of how to work with programming language, I began applying gained knowledge to creating my own pet projects.
It felt great to finally be able to give my ideas some real shape and actually putting them to use. For example, I've always struggled with maintaining my workout schedule; I never know what exercises I need to do, when I need to do them, and so on.

So once I had a good enough grasp on of how to work with sertain language structures, I wrote a small program that generated a list of exercises relevant to my present needs. I wrote it in Java. When I finally managed to get it to work and produce some meaningful results I felt immense joy at having accomplished what I once thought to be an impossible task!

Currently, I use vanilla JavaScript with pure CSS and HTML when working on course-assigned projects as well as on my own personal pet projects. I have yet to work with any of the popular CSS frameworks, but I am definetely looking forward to mastering them and using them in my own future projects.

The tasks I've encountered while attending this course have proven to be pretty challenging due to my lack of knowledge in certain areas. Like for example, there was a task that had me to creating a web application resembling the Google Momentum app. It is a simple app made up of numerous widgets that can display the weather, play music, or show time, among other things.  I struggled quite a lot with it, especially when it came to understanding and working with asynchronous requests and while also writing a function that would switch the application between different languages. It was bad. Right now I can do all that and even more! But it is only because of all the painstaking studying it took me to gain that level of understanding.

Looking back I realize that some of my successful projects and all of my failed ones helped a lot to improve my abilities and I can now see that I have accomplished a great deal and developed as a specialist as compared to when I first started studying programming.

That's why I'd never be able to, and frankly, would never want to, stop learning new things because all of the obstacles and challenges I face on my path would only serve to enhance my abilities and further cultivate my skills, giving me more opportunities to do things I like.

In the foreseeable future, I hope to put my skills to use in a professional setting becoming a full-fledged front-end developer.
In conclusion, I'd like to say that I'm very excited to continue expanding in this particular field while also giving more of my ideas life.

With that, I conclude my presentation.
Thank you for your attention and goodbye!
