Hi! My name is Sasha, I'm 24 and I am a Junior Researcher at the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. I received my formal education at Belarusian State University, where I majored in Biochemistry, followed by a master's degree in biology at the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, and right now I'm studying to become a Frontend Developer at Rolling Scopes School.

To begin, I'd like to state that I really enjoy studying and learning new things, so applying to this course seemed like a solid idea: it would give me a purpose, as well as the ability to further integrate with the IT community, to get some good and structured study program, and it would set a strict schedule that I would want to adhere to in order to achieve my goal.

Prior to applying for this course, I dabbled in writing small programs in Java and C languages while also attempting to learn the programming language in question, but I never had a strong sense of direction in which I wished to develop myself or any explicit goal that I wanted to achieve.

After learning the fundamentals of development and completing a couple of individual projects, I just fell in love with this line of work. Just seeing something you coded working and actually solving a problem and being useful is amazing!

So, once I had a good enough understanding of the programming language, I began applying what I had learned to create my own pet projects.
It felt great to finally be able to give my ideas some shape and put them to use. I, for example, have always struggled with maintaining my workout program; I never know what exercises I need to perform, how many of them I need to do, and so on.

When I had a good enough understanding of how to work with specific language structures, I created a simple program that generated a list of exercises relevant to my present needs. It was written in Java. When I finally managed to get it to work and produce some meaningful results I felt immense joy at having accomplished what I once thought to be an impossible task for me. It was amazing!

Currently, I use vanilla JavaScript with pure CSS and HTML when working on course-assigned tasks or my own pet projects. I have yet to work with any of the popular CSS frameworks, but I am looking forward to learning how to use them and incorporating them into my future projects.

The tasks I've encountered while attending this course have proven to be pretty challenging due to my lack of knowledge in certain areas. Like for example, there was a task that required me to create a web application similar to the Google Momentum app. It is a simple app made up of numerous widgets that can display the weather, play music, and show time, among other things.  I struggled quite a lot with it, especially when it came to understanding and working with asynchronous requests and creating a function that switched the app between languages. Right now I can do all that and even more! But it is only because of all the painstaking studying I had to do to reach that level of understanding.

Looking back I realize that some of my successful projects and all of my failed ones helped a lot to improve my abilities and I can now see that I have accomplished a great deal and developed as a specialist as compared to when I first began studying programming.

That is why I would never be able to, and frankly, would never want to, stop learning new THINGS since all of the obstacles and challenges I face on my path would only serve to enhance my abilities and further cultivate my skills, giving me more opportunity to do things I like.

In the foreseeable future, I hope to put my skills to use in a professional setting becoming a full-fledged front-end developer.
In conclusion, I'd like to say that I'm very excited to continue expanding in this particular field as well as giving more of my ideas life.

With that, I conclude my self-presentation.
Thank you for your attention and goodbye!
