## About Myself:

Currently I work as a Junior Researcher at Nathional Academy of Sciences of Belarus and a part-time freelance designer. Coding was a long-term interest of mine, I started studying different programming languages but without having any clear course I never settled on any. Being a fast learner I am adept at mastering new techniques and gaining new skills. I am a good team worker in addition to my having good interpersonal skills and in general being an outgoing person. I am a very determined person, therefore once I start a project I always finish it as soon as possible. 

I believe that with proper knowledge and experience I would be open to new opportunities and have novel ways to further develop my skills and prove myself.
